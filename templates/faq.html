  <strong id='faq-estimated-taxes'>How much in property taxes will I pay?</strong>
  <p>The amount of yearly property tax you will pay is determined by the <a href='http://www.cookcountyassessor.com/'>Cook County Assessor</a> and based on the <a href='http://www.cookcountyassessor.com/propertyvaluation.aspx'>assessed value</a> of the property and the tax rates for all local governments providing services in your community.</p>

  <p>To get a sense of what the property tax will be for your vacant lot, we took a look at the taxes paid for a few vacant lots sold by the City of Chicago:</p>

  <p>No you will not. When the lot is sold, no unpaid taxes by the previous owner will be transferred to you.</p>
