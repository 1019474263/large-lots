    <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

    <strong id='faq-timeline'>Once I apply, how long will it take to hear back?</strong>
    <p>Applicants will receive information regarding the status of their application in mid-September, about 6 weeks after the application period has ended.</p>

    <strong id='faq-evaluation'>How will applications be evaluated?</strong>
    <p>The main point of evaluation is the completeness of the application and proof of ownership. If multiple requests are submitted for the same property the City will review on a case by case basis.</p>

    <strong id='faq-estimated-taxes'>How much in property taxes will I pay?</strong>
    <p>The amount of yearly property tax you will pay is determined by the <a href='http://www.cookcountyassessor.com/'>Cook County Assessor</a> and based on the <a href='http://www.cookcountyassessor.com/propertyvaluation.aspx'>assessed value</a> of the property and the tax rates for all local governments providing services in your community.</p>

    <p>To get a sense of what the property tax will be for your vacant lot, we took a look at the taxes paid for a few vacant lots sold by the City of Chicago:</p>

    <strong id='faq-back-taxes'>Will I have to pay back taxes?</strong>
    <p>No you will not. When the lot is sold, no unpaid taxes by the previous owner will be transferred to you.</p>

    <strong id='faq-history'>How did the Large Lot Program come to be?</strong>
    <p>The Large Lot Program is a housing land use approach that was developed as part of the <a href='http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/dcd/supp_info/green-healthy-neighborhoods.html'>Green Healthy Neighborhoods</a> public planning process. The program is being piloted in community areas where the City owns large amounts of vacant land. The goals core goals of the program are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Give local residents greater control over vacant land in their neighborhood</li>
      <li>Dispose of some of the City-owned land in these neighborhoods efficiently, which returns the land to the tax rolls</li>
      <li>Create wealth in the community by allowing owners to sell land after five years</li>
      <li>Increase safety, build community, and raise home values by creating more neighborhood-level investment</li>
    </ul>
