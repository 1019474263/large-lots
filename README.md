# Large Lots

The City of Cleveland Land Bank sells vacant lots to homeowners for a side yard expansion. 

Large Lots enables you to find if there is a vacant lot adjacent to your property that is eligible to be purchased for a side yard expansion and to complete the Land Bank's application. 


A public website is not currently available. 

This is based on a similar project in Chicago, called [Large Lots](http://www.largelots.org) made by Data Made.
